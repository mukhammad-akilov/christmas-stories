            </p>
            <p>ONE dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one&rsquo;s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.</p>

            <p>There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.</p>

            <p>While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.</p>

            <p>In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name &ldquo;Mr. James Dillingham Young.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The &ldquo;Dillingham&rdquo; had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.</p>

            <p>Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn&rsquo;t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling&mdash;something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.</p>

            <p>There was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.</p>

            <p>Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.</p>

            <p>Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim&rsquo;s gold watch that had been his father&rsquo;s and his grandfather&rsquo;s. The other was Della&rsquo;s hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty&rsquo;s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.</p>

            <p>So now Della&rsquo;s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.</p>

            <p>On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.</p>

            <p>Where she stopped the sign read: &ldquo;Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.&rdquo; One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the &ldquo;Sofronie.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Will you buy my hair?&rdquo; asked Della.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I buy hair,&rdquo; said Madame. &ldquo;Take yer hat off and let&rsquo;s have a sight at the looks of it.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Down rippled the brown cascade.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Twenty dollars,&rdquo; said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Give it to me quick,&rdquo; said Della.</p>

            <p>Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim&rsquo;s present.</p>

            <p>She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation&mdash;as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim&rsquo;s. It was like him. Quietness and value&mdash;the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.</p>

            <p>When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends&mdash;a mammoth task.</p>

            <p>Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;If Jim doesn&rsquo;t kill me,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;before he takes a second look at me, he&rsquo;ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do&mdash;oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>At 7 o&rsquo;clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.</p>

            <p>Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: &ldquo;Please God, make him think I am still pretty.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two&mdash;and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.</p>

            <p>Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.</p>

            <p>Della wriggled off the table and went for him.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Jim, darling,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn&rsquo;t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It&rsquo;ll grow out again&mdash;you won&rsquo;t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say &lsquo;Merry Christmas!&rsquo; Jim, and let&rsquo;s be happy. You don&rsquo;t know what a nice&mdash;what a beautiful, nice gift I&rsquo;ve got for you.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve cut off your hair?&rdquo; asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Cut it off and sold it,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like me just as well, anyhow? I&rsquo;m me without my hair, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Jim looked about the room curiously.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;You say your hair is gone?&rdquo; he said, with an air almost of idiocy.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look for it,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sold, I tell you&mdash;sold and gone, too. It&rsquo;s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,&rdquo; she went on with sudden serious sweetness, &ldquo;but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year&mdash;what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.</p>

            <p>Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any mistake, Dell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about me. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you&rsquo;ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.</p>

            <p>For there lay The Combs&mdash;the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims&mdash;just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.</p>

            <p>But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: &ldquo;My hair grows so fast, Jim!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You&rsquo;ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Dell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s put our Christmas presents away and keep &rsquo;em a while. They&rsquo;re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The magi, as you know, were wise men&mdash;wonderfully wise men&mdash;who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes.</p>

            <p>Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening. He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.</p>

            <p>The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more. In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and the good man soon became thriving and well off again.</p>

            <p>One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over the fire chatting together, he said to her, &lsquo;I should like to sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me.&rsquo; The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up there, and watched what would happen.</p>

            <p>As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker&rsquo;s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as lightning.</p>

            <p>The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. &lsquo;These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold. I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do.</p>

            <p>About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted.</p>

            <p>Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green.</p>

            <p>The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Santa Claus lives in the Laughing Valley, where stands the big, rambling castle in which his toys are manufactured. His workmen, selected from the ryls, knooks, pixies and fairies, live with him, and every one is as busy as can be from one year's end to another.</p>

            <p>It is called the Laughing Valley because everything there is happy and gay. The brook chuckles to itself as it leaps rollicking between its green banks; the wind whistles merrily in the trees; the sunbeams dance lightly over the soft grass, and the violets and wild flowers look smilingly up from their green nests. To laugh one needs to be happy; to be happy one needs to be content. And throughout the Laughing Valley of Santa Claus contentment reigns supreme.</p>

            <p>On one side is the mighty Forest of Burzee. At the other side stands the huge mountain that contains the Caves of the Daemons. And between them the Valley lies smiling and peaceful.</p>

            <p>One would thing that our good old Santa Claus, who devotes his days to making children happy, would have no enemies on all the earth; and, as a matter of fact, for a long period of time he encountered nothing but love wherever he might go.</p>

            <p>But the Daemons who live in the mountain caves grew to hate Santa Claus very much, and all for the simple reason that he made children happy.</p>

            <p>The Caves of the Daemons are five in number. A broad pathway leads up to the first cave, which is a finely arched cavern at the foot of the mountain, the entrance being beautifully carved and decorated. In it resides the Daemon of Selfishness. Back of this is another cavern inhabited by the Daemon of Envy. The cave of the Daemon of Hatred is next in order, and through this one passes to the home of the Daemon of Malice&mdash;situated in a dark and fearful cave in the very heart of the mountain. I do not know what lies beyond this. Some say there are terrible pitfalls leading to death and destruction, and this may very well be true. However, from each one of the four caves mentioned there is a small, narrow tunnel leading to the fifth cave&mdash;a cozy little room occupied by the Daemon of Repentance. And as the rocky floors of these passages are well worn by the track of passing feet, I judge that many wanderers in the Caves of the Daemons have escaped through the tunnels to the abode of the Daemon of Repentance, who is said to be a pleasant sort of fellow who gladly opens for one a little door admitting you into fresh air and sunshine again.</p>

            <p>Well, these Daemons of the Caves, thinking they had great cause to dislike old Santa Claus, held a meeting one day to discuss the matter.</p>

            <p>&quot;I'm really getting lonesome,&quot; said the Daemon of Selfishness. &quot;For Santa Claus distributes so many pretty Christmas gifts to all the children that they become happy and generous, through his example, and keep away from my cave.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I'm having the same trouble,&quot; rejoined the Daemon of Envy. &quot;The little ones seem quite content with Santa Claus, and there are few, indeed, that I can coax to become envious.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;And that makes it bad for me!&quot; declared the Daemon of Hatred. &quot;For if no children pass through the Caves of Selfishness and Envy, none can get to MY cavern.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Or to mine,&quot; added the Daemon of Malice.</p>

            <p>&quot;For my part,&quot; said the Daemon of Repentance, &quot;it is easily seen that if children do not visit your caves they have no need to visit mine; so that I am quite as neglected as you are.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;And all because of this person they call Santa Claus!&quot; exclaimed the Daemon of Envy. &quot;He is simply ruining our business, and something must be done at once.&quot;</p>

            <p>To this they readily agreed; but what to do was another and more difficult matter to settle. They knew that Santa Claus worked all through the year at his castle in the Laughing Valley, preparing the gifts he was to distribute on Christmas Eve; and at first they resolved to try to tempt him into their caves, that they might lead him on to the terrible pitfalls that ended in destruction.</p>

            <p>So the very next day, while Santa Claus was busily at work, surrounded by his little band of assistants, the Daemon of Selfishness came to him and said:</p>

            <p>&quot;These toys are wonderfully bright and pretty. Why do you not keep them for yourself? It's a pity to give them to those noisy boys and fretful girls, who break and destroy them so quickly.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; cried the old graybeard, his bright eyes twinkling merrily as he turned toward the tempting Daemon. &quot;The boys and girls are never so noisy and fretful after receiving my presents, and if I can make them happy for one day in the year I am quite content.&quot;</p>

            <p>So the Daemon went back to the others, who awaited him in their caves, and said:</p>

            <p>&quot;I have failed, for Santa Claus is not at all selfish.&quot;</p>

            <p>The following day the Daemon of Envy visited Santa Claus. Said he: &quot;The toy shops are full of playthings quite as pretty as those you are making. What a shame it is that they should interfere with your business! They make toys by machinery much quicker than you can make them by hand; and they sell them for money, while you get nothing at all for your work.&quot;</p>

            <p>But Santa Claus refused to be envious of the toy shops.</p>

            <p>&quot;I can supply the little ones but once a year&mdash;on Christmas Eve,&quot; he answered; &quot;for the children are many, and I am but one. And as my work is one of love and kindness I would be ashamed to receive money for my little gifts. But throughout all the year the children must be amused in some way, and so the toy shops are able to bring much happiness to my little friends. I like the toy shops, and am glad to see them prosper.&quot;</p>

            <p>In spite of the second rebuff, the Daemon of Hatred thought he would try to influence Santa Claus. So the next day he entered the busy workshop and said:</p>

            <p>&quot;Good morning, Santa! I have bad news for you.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Then run away, like a good fellow,&quot; answered Santa Claus. &quot;Bad news is something that should be kept secret and never told.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You cannot escape this, however,&quot; declared the Daemon; &quot;for in the world are a good many who do not believe in Santa Claus, and these you are bound to hate bitterly, since they have so wronged you.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Stuff and rubbish!&quot; cried Santa.</p>

            <p>&quot;And there are others who resent your making children happy and who sneer at you and call you a foolish old rattlepate! You are quite right to hate such base slanderers, and you ought to be revenged upon them for their evil words.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;But I don't hate 'em!&quot; exclaimed Santa Claus positively. &quot;Such people do me no real harm, but merely render themselves and their children unhappy. Poor things! I'd much rather help them any day than injure them.&quot;</p>

            <p>Indeed, the Daemons could not tempt old Santa Claus in any way. On the contrary, he was shrewd enough to see that their object in visiting him was to make mischief and trouble, and his cheery laughter disconcerted the evil ones and showed to them the folly of such an undertaking. So they abandoned honeyed words and determined to use force.</p>

            <p>It was well known that no harm can come to Santa Claus while he is in the Laughing Valley, for the fairies, and ryls, and knooks all protect him. But on Christmas Eve he drives his reindeer out into the big world, carrying a sleighload of toys and pretty gifts to the children; and this was the time and the occasion when his enemies had the best chance to injure him. So the Daemons laid their plans and awaited the arrival of Christmas Eve.</p>

            <p>The moon shone big and white in the sky, and the snow lay crisp and sparkling on the ground as Santa Claus cracked his whip and sped away out of the Valley into the great world beyond. The roomy sleigh was packed full with huge sacks of toys, and as the reindeer dashed onward our jolly old Santa laughed and whistled and sang for very joy. For in all his merry life this was the one day in the year when he was happiest&mdash;the day he lovingly bestowed the treasures of his workshop upon the little children.</p>

            <p>It would be a busy night for him, he well knew. As he whistled and shouted and cracked his whip again, he reviewed in mind all the towns and cities and farmhouses where he was expected, and figured that he had just enough presents to go around and make every child happy. The reindeer knew exactly what was expected of them, and dashed along so swiftly that their feet scarcely seemed to touch the snow-covered ground.</p>

            <p>Suddenly a strange thing happened: a rope shot through the moonlight and a big noose that was in the end of it settled over the arms and body of Santa Claus and drew tight. Before he could resist or even cry out he was jerked from the seat of the sleigh and tumbled head foremost into a snowbank, while the reindeer rushed onward with the load of toys and carried it quickly out of sight and sound.</p>

            <p>Such a surprising experience confused old Santa for a moment, and when he had collected his senses he found that the wicked Daemons had pulled him from the snowdrift and bound him tightly with many coils of the stout rope. And then they carried the kidnapped Santa Claus away to their mountain, where they thrust the prisoner into a secret cave and chained him to the rocky wall so that he could not escape.</p>

            <p>&quot;Ha, ha!&quot; laughed the Daemons, rubbing their hands together with cruel glee. &quot;What will the children do now? How they will cry and scold and storm when they find there are no toys in their stockings and no gifts on their Christmas trees! And what a lot of punishment they will receive from their parents, and how they will flock to our Caves of Selfishness, and Envy, and Hatred, and Malice! We have done a mighty clever thing, we Daemons of the Caves!&quot;</p>

            <p>Now it so chanced that on this Christmas Eve the good Santa Claus had taken with him in his sleigh Nuter the Ryl, Peter the Knook, Kilter the Pixie, and a small fairy named Wisk&mdash;his four favorite assistants. These little people he had often found very useful in helping him to distribute his gifts to the children, and when their master was so suddenly dragged from the sleigh they were all snugly tucked underneath the seat, where the sharp wind could not reach them.</p>

            <p>The tiny immortals knew nothing of the capture of Santa Claus until some time after he had disappeared. But finally they missed his cheery voice, and as their master always sang or whistled on his journeys, the silence warned them that something was wrong.</p>

            <p>Little Wisk stuck out his head from underneath the seat and found Santa Claus gone and no one to direct the flight of the reindeer. &quot;Whoa!&quot; he called out, and the deer obediently slackened speed and came to a halt.</p>

            <p>Peter and Nuter and Kilter all jumped upon the seat and looked back over the track made by the sleigh. But Santa Claus had been left miles and miles behind.</p>

            <p>&quot;What shall we do?&quot; asked Wisk anxiously, all the mirth and mischief banished from his wee face by this great calamity.</p>

            <p>&quot;We must go back at once and find our master,&quot; said Nuter the Ryl, who thought and spoke with much deliberation.</p>

            <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; exclaimed Peter the Knook, who, cross and crabbed though he was, might always be depended upon in an emergency. &quot;If we delay, or go back, there will not be time to get the toys to the children before morning; and that would grieve Santa Claus more than anything else.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;It is certain that some wicked creatures have captured him,&quot; added Kilter thoughtfully, &quot;and their object must be to make the children unhappy. So our first duty is to get the toys distributed as carefully as if Santa Claus were himself present. Afterward we can search for our master and easily secure his freedom.&quot;</p>

            <p>This seemed such good and sensible advice that the others at once resolved to adopt it. So Peter the Knook called to the reindeer, and the faithful animals again sprang forward and dashed over hill and valley, through forest and plain, until they came to the houses wherein children lay sleeping and dreaming of the pretty gifts they would find on Christmas morning.</p>

            <p>The little immortals had set themselves a difficult task; for although they had assisted Santa Claus on many of his journeys, their master had always directed and guided them and told them exactly what he wished them to do. But now they had to distribute the toys according to their own judgment, and they did not understand children as well as did old Santa. So it is no wonder they made some laughable errors.</p>

            <p>Mamie Brown, who wanted a doll, got a drum instead; and a drum is of no use to a girl who loves dolls. And Charlie Smith, who delights to romp and play out of doors, and who wanted some new rubber boots to keep his feet dry, received a sewing box filled with colored worsteds and threads and needles, which made him so provoked that he thoughtlessly called our dear Santa Claus a fraud.</p>

            <p>Had there been many such mistakes the Daemons would have accomplished their evil purpose and made the children unhappy. But the little friends of the absent Santa Claus labored faithfully and intelligently to carry out their master's ideas, and they made fewer errors than might be expected under such unusual circumstances.</p>

            <p>And, although they worked as swiftly as possible, day had begun to break before the toys and other presents were all distributed; so for the first time in many years the reindeer trotted into the Laughing Valley, on their return, in broad daylight, with the brilliant sun peeping over the edge of the forest to prove they were far behind their accustomed hours.</p>

            <p>Having put the deer in the stable, the little folk began to wonder how they might rescue their master; and they realized they must discover, first of all, what had happened to him and where he was.</p>

            <p>So Wisk the Fairy transported himself to the bower of the Fairy Queen, which was located deep in the heart of the Forest of Burzee; and once there, it did not take him long to find out all about the naughty Daemons and how they had kidnapped the good Santa Claus to prevent his making children happy. The Fairy Queen also promised her assistance, and then, fortified by this powerful support, Wisk flew back to where Nuter and Peter and Kilter awaited him, and the four counseled together and laid plans to rescue their master from his enemies.</p>

            <p>It is possible that Santa Claus was not as merry as usual during the night that succeeded his capture. For although he had faith in the judgment of his little friends he could not avoid a certain amount of worry, and an anxious look would creep at times into his kind old eyes as he thought of the disappointment that might await his dear little children. And the Daemons, who guarded him by turns, one after another, did not neglect to taunt him with contemptuous words in his helpless condition.</p>

            <p>When Christmas Day dawned the Daemon of Malice was guarding the prisoner, and his tongue was sharper than that of any of the others.</p>

            <p>&quot;The children are waking up, Santa!&quot; he cried. &quot;They are waking up to find their stockings empty! Ho, ho! How they will quarrel, and wail, and stamp their feet in anger! Our caves will be full today, old Santa! Our caves are sure to be full!&quot;</p>

            <p>But to this, as to other like taunts, Santa Claus answered nothing. He was much grieved by his capture, it is true; but his courage did not forsake him. And, finding that the prisoner would not reply to his jeers, the Daemon of Malice presently went away, and sent the Daemon of Repentance to take his place.</p>

            <p>This last personage was not so disagreeable as the others. He had gentle and refined features, and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone.</p>

            <p>&quot;My brother Daemons do not trust me overmuch,&quot; said he, as he entered the cavern; &quot;but it is morning, now, and the mischief is done. You cannot visit the children again for another year.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;That is true,&quot; answered Santa Claus, almost cheerfully; &quot;Christmas Eve is past, and for the first time in centuries I have not visited my children.&quot; &quot;The little ones will be greatly disappointed,&quot; murmured the Daemon of Repentance, almost regretfully; &quot;but that cannot be helped now. Their grief is likely to make the children selfish and envious and hateful, and if they come to the Caves of the Daemons today I shall get a chance to lead some of them to my Cave of Repentance.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Do you never repent, yourself?&quot; asked Santa Claus, curiously.</p>

            <p>&quot;Oh, yes, indeed,&quot; answered the Daemon. &quot;I am even now repenting that I assisted in your capture. Of course it is too late to remedy the evil that has been done; but repentance, you know, can come only after an evil thought or deed, for in the beginning there is nothing to repent of.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;So I understand,&quot; said Santa Claus. &quot;Those who avoid evil need never visit your cave.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;As a rule, that is true,&quot; replied the Daemon; &quot;yet you, who have done no evil, are about to visit my cave at once; for to prove that I sincerely regret my share in your capture I am going to permit you to escape.&quot;</p>

            <p>This speech greatly surprised the prisoner, until he reflected that it was just what might be expected of the Daemon of Repentance. The fellow at once busied himself untying the knots that bound Santa Claus and unlocking the chains that fastened him to the wall. Then he led the way through a long tunnel until they both emerged in the Cave of Repentance.</p>

            <p>&quot;I hope you will forgive me,&quot; said the Daemon pleadingly. &quot;I am not really a bad person, you know; and I believe I accomplish a great deal of good in the world.&quot;</p>

            <p>With this he opened a back door that let in a flood of sunshine, and Santa Claus sniffed the fresh air gratefully. &quot;I bear no malice,&quot; said he to the Daemon, in a gentle voice; &quot;and I am sure the world would be a dreary place without you. So, good morning, and a Merry Christmas to you!&quot;</p>

            <p>With these words he stepped out to greet the bright morning, and a moment later he was trudging along, whistling softly to himself, on his way to his home in the Laughing Valley.</p>

            <p>Marching over the snow toward the mountain was a vast army, made up of the most curious creatures imaginable. There were numberless knooks from the forest, as rough and crooked in appearance as the gnarled branches of the trees they ministered to. And there were dainty ryls from the fields, each one bearing the emblem of the flower or plant it guarded. Behind these were many ranks of pixies, gnomes and nymphs, and in the rear a thousand beautiful fairies floated along in gorgeous array.</p>

            <p>This wonderful army was led by Wisk, Peter, Nuter, and Kilter, who had assembled it to rescue Santa Claus from captivity and to punish the Daemons who had dared to take him away from his beloved children.</p>

            <p>And, although they looked so bright and peaceful, the little immortals were armed with powers that would be very terrible to those who had incurred their anger. Woe to the Daemons of the Caves if this mighty army of vengeance ever met them!</p>

            <p>But lo! coming to meet his loyal friends appeared the imposing form of Santa Claus, his white beard floating in the breeze and his bright eyes sparkling with pleasure at this proof of the love and veneration he had inspired in the hearts of the most powerful creatures in existence.</p>

            <p>And while they clustered around him and danced with glee at his safe return, he gave them earnest thanks for their support. But Wisk, and Nuter, and Peter, and Kilter, he embraced affectionately.</p>

            <p>&quot;It is useless to pursue the Daemons,&quot; said Santa Claus to the army. &quot;They have their place in the world, and can never be destroyed. But that is a great pity, nevertheless,&quot; he continued musingly.</p>

            <p>So the fairies, and knooks, and pixies, and ryls all escorted the good man to his castle, and there left him to talk over the events of the night with his little assistants.</p>

            <p>Wisk had already rendered himself invisible and flown through the big world to see how the children were getting along on this bright Christmas morning; and by the time he returned, Peter had finished telling Santa Claus of how they had distributed the toys.</p>

            <p>&quot;We really did very well,&quot; cried the fairy, in a pleased voice; &quot;for I found little unhappiness among the children this morning. Still, you must not get captured again, my dear master; for we might not be so fortunate another time in carrying out your ideas.&quot;</p>

            <p>He then related the mistakes that had been made, and which he had not discovered until his tour of inspection. And Santa Claus at once sent him with rubber boots for Charlie Smith, and a doll for Mamie Brown; so that even those two disappointed ones became happy.</p>

            <p>As for the wicked Daemons of the Caves, they were filled with anger and chagrin when they found that their clever capture of Santa Claus had come to naught. Indeed, no one on that Christmas Day appeared to be at all selfish, or envious, or hateful. And, realizing that while the children's saint had so many powerful friends it was folly to oppose him, the Daemons never again attempted to interfere with his journeys on Christmas Eve.</p>

            <p>My Dear Susie Clemens,</p>

            <p>I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me...I can read your and your baby sister's jagged and fantastic marks without any trouble at all. But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. You will find that I made no mistakes about the things which you and the baby ordered in your own letters&mdash;I went down your chimney at midnight when you were asleep and delivered them all myself--and kissed both of you, too...But...there were...one or two small orders which I could not fill because we ran out of stock...</p>

            <p>There was a word or two in your mama's letter which...I took to be &quot;a trunk full of doll's clothes.&quot; Is that it? I will call at your kitchen door about nine o'clock this morning to inquire. But I must not see anybody and I must not speak to anybody but you. When the kitchen doorbell rings, George must be blindfolded and sent to the door. You must tell George he must walk on tiptoe and not speak&mdash;otherwise he will die someday. Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your ear to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, &quot;Welcome, Santa Claus!&quot; Then I will ask whether it was a trunk you ordered or not. If you say it was, I shall ask you what color you want the trunk to be...and then you must tell me every single thing in detail which you want the trunk to contain. Then when I say &quot;Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens,&quot; you must say &quot;Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much.&quot; Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while. I will go to the moon and get those things and in a few minutes I will come down the chimney that belongs to the fireplace that is in the hall&mdash;if it is a trunk you want--because I couldn't get such a thing as a trunk down the nursery chimney, you know...If I should leave any snow in the hall, you must tell George to sweep it into the fireplace, for I haven't time to do such things. George must not use a broom, but a rag&mdash;else he will die someday...If my boot should leave a stain on the marble, George must not holystone it away. Leave it there always in memory of my visit; and whenever you look at it or show it to anybody you must let it remind you to be a good little girl. Whenever you are naughty and someone points to that mark which your good old Santa Claus's boot made on the marble, what will you say, little sweetheart?</p>

            <p>Good-by for a few minutes, till I come down to the world and ring the kitchen doorbell.</p>

            <p>Your loving Santa Claus Whom people sometimes call &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;</p>

            </p>
            <p>A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o&rsquo;clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener&rsquo;s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, &lsquo;One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>Then the gardener&rsquo;s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, &lsquo;Do not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.&rsquo; But the son thought to himself, &lsquo;What can such a beast as this know about the matter?&rsquo; So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor. &lsquo;I should be very silly,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if I went to that shabby house, and left this charming place&rsquo;; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.</p>

            <p>Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner.</p>

            <p>Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, &lsquo;Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.&rsquo; So he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind.</p>

            <p>When they came to the village, the son followed the fox&rsquo;s counsel, and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he was beginning his journey, and said, &lsquo;Go straight forward, till you come to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise you will repent it.&rsquo; Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.</p>

            <p>Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, &lsquo;It will be a very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage&rsquo;; so he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage. But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his own.</p>

            <p>So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair, when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, &lsquo;You see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.&rsquo; Then the son sat down on the fox&rsquo;s tail, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.</p>

            <p>All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it. &lsquo;I will give him the good one,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I am sure he deserves it.&rsquo; As he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own.</p>

            <p>Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, &lsquo;Why did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve o&rsquo;clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.&rsquo; Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again.</p>

            <p>As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o&rsquo;clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father&rsquo;s house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again.</p>

            <p>Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, &lsquo;You shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window.&rsquo; Now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said. &lsquo;Lie down and go to sleep; I will work for you.&rsquo; And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess.</p>

            <p>Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, &lsquo;We will have all three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the young man, &lsquo;that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?&rsquo;</p>

            <p>&lsquo;If you will only listen,&rsquo; said the fox, &lsquo;it can be done. When you come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, &ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo; Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as fast as you can.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>All went right: then the fox said, &lsquo;When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox came, and said, &lsquo;Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.&rsquo; But the young man refused to do it: so the fox said, &lsquo;I will at any rate give you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows, and sit down by the side of no river.&rsquo; Then away he went. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; thought the young man, &lsquo;it is no hard matter to keep that advice.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, &lsquo;Two men are going to be hanged.&rsquo; As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, &lsquo;Cannot they in any way be saved?&rsquo; But the people said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; unless he would bestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were given up, and went on with him towards their home.</p>

            <p>And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, &lsquo;Let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.&rsquo; So he said, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and forgot the fox&rsquo;s counsel, and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went home to the king their master, and said. &lsquo;All this have we won by our labour.&rsquo; Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.</p>

            <p>The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river&rsquo;s bed: luckily it was nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him: &lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I cannot leave you here, so lay hold of my tail and hold fast.&rsquo; Then he pulled him out of the river, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, &lsquo;Your brothers have set watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.&rsquo; So he dressed himself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king&rsquo;s court, and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers&rsquo; roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king&rsquo;s death he was heir to his kingdom.</p>

            <p>A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the princess, who had been lost a great many many years.</p>

            <p>Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right&mdash;all that falls to them is so much gain&mdash;all their geese are swans&mdash;all their cards are trumps&mdash;toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it know about the matter?</p>

            <p>One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had worked hard for his master. At last he said, &lsquo;Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.&rsquo; And the master said, &lsquo;You have been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.&rsquo; Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head.</p>

            <p>Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Hans aloud, &lsquo;what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.&rsquo; Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, &lsquo;Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can&rsquo;t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.&rsquo; &lsquo;What do you say of making an exchange?&rsquo; said the horseman. &lsquo;I will give you my horse, and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.&rsquo; &lsquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; said Hans: &lsquo;but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing&mdash;you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.&rsquo; However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, &lsquo;When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry &ldquo;Jip!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

            <p>Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,</p>

            <p>&lsquo;No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow! We&rsquo;ll laugh and be merry, Sing neigh down derry!&rsquo;</p>

            <p>After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and cried &lsquo;Jip!&rsquo; Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd, &lsquo;This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break his neck. However, I&rsquo;m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one&rsquo;s leisure behind that cow&mdash;keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day, into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the shepherd, &lsquo;if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Done!&rsquo; said Hans, merrily. &lsquo;What a noble heart that good man has!&rsquo; thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away he rode.</p>

            <p>Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one. &lsquo;If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?&rsquo; When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother&rsquo;s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. &lsquo;I can find a cure for this,&rsquo; thought he; &lsquo;now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst&rsquo;: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that.</p>

            <p>While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. &lsquo;What is the matter with you, my man?&rsquo; said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, &lsquo;There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don&rsquo;t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas, alas!&rsquo; said Hans, &lsquo;who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now&mdash;like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease&mdash;one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the butcher, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.&rsquo; &lsquo;Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!&rsquo; said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.</p>

            <p>So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all. How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got?</p>

            <p>The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The countryman stopped to ask what was o&rsquo;clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a christening. &lsquo;Feel,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!&rsquo; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; said Hans, as he weighed it in his hand; &lsquo;but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.&rsquo; Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. &lsquo;Hark ye!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can&rsquo;t help doing you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire&rsquo;s pig. If you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?&rsquo;</p>

            <p>Poor Hans was sadly frightened. &lsquo;Good man,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;pray get me out of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born; but he may have been the squire&rsquo;s for aught I can tell: you know this country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.&rsquo; &lsquo;I ought to have something into the bargain,&rsquo; said the countryman; &lsquo;give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! &lsquo;Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.&rsquo; Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;that chap is pretty well taken in. I don&rsquo;t care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel, working and singing,</p>

            <p>&lsquo;O&rsquo;er hill and o&rsquo;er dale So happy I roam, Work light and live well, All the world is my home; Then who so blythe, so merry as I?&rsquo;</p>

            <p>Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, &lsquo;You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it&mdash;but where did you get that beautiful goose?&rsquo; &lsquo;I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.&rsquo; &lsquo;And where did you get the pig?&rsquo; &lsquo;I gave a cow for it.&rsquo; &lsquo;And the cow?&rsquo; &lsquo;I gave a horse for it.&rsquo; &lsquo;And the horse?&rsquo; &lsquo;I gave a lump of silver as big as my head for it.&rsquo; &lsquo;And the silver?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh! I worked hard for that seven long years.&rsquo; &lsquo;You have thriven well in the world hitherto,&rsquo; said the grinder, &lsquo;now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand in it, your fortune would be made.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very true: but how is that to be managed?&rsquo; &lsquo;How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the value of your goose for it&mdash;will you buy?&rsquo; &lsquo;How can you ask?&rsquo; said Hans; &lsquo;I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there&rsquo;s the goose.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone that lay by his side, &lsquo;this is a most capital stone; do but work it well enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, &lsquo;Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself. People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow.</p>

            <p>At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.</p>

            <p>For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone.</p>

            <p>&lsquo;How happy am I!&rsquo; cried he; &lsquo;nobody was ever so lucky as I.&rsquo; Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother&rsquo;s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.</p>

            <p>There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.</p>

            <p>Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, &lsquo;We must take care that we don&rsquo;t go too near to the fairy&rsquo;s castle.&rsquo; It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches.</p>

            <p>Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take.</p>

            <p>The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,</p>

            <p> &lsquo;The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!  He mourn&rsquo;d for the fate of his darling mate,  Well-a-day!&rsquo; when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended with a mournful jug, jug. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them, and three times screamed:</p>

            <p> &lsquo;Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!&rsquo; Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.</p>

            <p>She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone&mdash;but what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice:</p>

            <p> &lsquo;Till the prisoner is fast,  And her doom is cast,  There stay! Oh, stay!  When the charm is around her,  And the spell has bound her,  Hie away! away!&rsquo; On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way.</p>

            <p>He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;what will become of me?&rsquo; He could not go back to his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.</p>

            <p>At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again.</p>

            <p>In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle.</p>

            <p>He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.</p>

            <p>Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy&rsquo;s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.</p>

            <p>An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the great city, &lsquo;For there,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;I may turn musician.&rsquo;</p>

            <p>After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the roadside and panting as if he were tired. &lsquo;What makes you pant so, my friend?&rsquo; said the ass. &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said the dog, &lsquo;my master was going to knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?&rsquo; &lsquo;Hark ye!&rsquo; said the ass, &lsquo;I am going to the great city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the same way?&rsquo; The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on together.</p>

            <p>They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face. &lsquo;Pray, my good lady,&rsquo; said the ass, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, me!&rsquo; said the cat, &lsquo;how can one be in good spirits when one&rsquo;s life is in danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the ass, &lsquo;by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.&rsquo; The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.</p>

            <p>Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main. &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; said the ass; &lsquo;upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what is all this about?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the cock, &lsquo;I was just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook don&rsquo;t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!&rsquo; &lsquo;Heaven forbid!&rsquo; said the ass, &lsquo;come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.&rsquo; &lsquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.</p>

            <p>They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said, &lsquo;There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.&rsquo; &lsquo;If that be the case,&rsquo; said the ass, &lsquo;we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the world!&rsquo; &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; added the dog, &lsquo;I should not be the worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.&rsquo; So they walked off together towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived.</p>

            <p>The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and peeped in. &lsquo;Well, Donkey,&rsquo; said Chanticleer, &lsquo;what do you see?&rsquo; &lsquo;What do I see?&rsquo; replied the ass. &lsquo;Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.&rsquo; &lsquo;That would be a noble lodging for us,&rsquo; said the cock. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the ass, &lsquo;if we could only get in&rsquo;; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog&rsquo;s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat&rsquo;s head. When all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them, and scampered away as fast as they could.</p>

            <p>The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.</p>

            <p>But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, &lsquo;Throw the rascal up here!&rsquo; After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.</p>

            <p>It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark. Evening came on, the last evening of the year. In the cold and gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets. Of course when she had left her house she'd had slippers on, but what good had they been? They were very big slippers, way too big for her, for they belonged to her mother. The little girl had lost them running across the road, where two carriages had rattled by terribly fast. One slipper she'd not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own. And so the little girl walked on her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried several packages of matches, and she held a box of them in her hand. No one had bought any from her all day long, and no one had given her a cent.</p>

            <p>Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along, a picture of misery, poor little girl! The snowflakes fell on her long fair hair, which hung in pretty curls over her neck. In all the windows lights were shining, and there was a wonderful smell of roast goose, for it was New Year's eve. Yes, she thought of that!</p>

            <p>In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected farther out into the street than the other, she sat down and drew up her little feet under her. She was getting colder and colder, but did not dare to go home, for she had sold no matches, nor earned a single cent, and her father would surely beat her. Besides, it was cold at home, for they had nothing over them but a roof through which the wind whistled even though the biggest cracks had been stuffed with straw and rags.</p>

            <p>Her hands were almost dead with cold. Oh, how much one little match might warm her! If she could only take one from the box and rub it against the wall and warm her hands. She drew one out. R-r-ratch! How it sputtered and burned! It made a warm, bright flame, like a little candle, as she held her hands over it; but it gave a strange light! It really seemed to the little girl as if she were sitting before a great iron stove with shining brass knobs and a brass cover. How wonderfully the fire burned! How comfortable it was! The youngster stretched out her feet to warm them too; then the little flame went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the burnt match in her hand.</p>

            <p>She struck another match against the wall. It burned brightly, and when the light fell upon the wall it became transparent like a thin veil, and she could see through it into a room. On the table a snow-white cloth was spread, and on it stood a shining dinner service. The roast goose steamed gloriously, stuffed with apples and prunes. And what was still better, the goose jumped down from the dish and waddled along the floor with a knife and fork in its breast, right over to the little girl. Then the match went out, and she could see only the thick, cold wall. She lighted another match. Then she was sitting under the most beautiful Christmas tree. It was much larger and much more beautiful than the one she had seen last Christmas through the glass door at the rich merchant's home. Thousands of candles burned on the green branches, and colored pictures like those in the printshops looked down at her. The little girl reached both her hands toward them. Then the match went out. But the Christmas lights mounted higher. She saw them now as bright stars in the sky. One of them fell down, forming a long line of fire.</p>

            <p>&quot;Now someone is dying,&quot; thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star fell down a soul went up to God.</p>

            <p>She rubbed another match against the wall. It became bright again, and in the glow the old grandmother stood clear and shining, kind and lovely.</p>

            <p>&quot;Grandmother!&quot; cried the child. &quot;Oh, take me with you! I know you will disappear when the match is burned out. You will vanish like the warm stove, the wonderful roast goose and the beautiful big Christmas tree!&quot;</p>

            <p>And she quickly struck the whole bundle of matches, for she wished to keep her grandmother with her. And the matches burned with such a glow that it became brighter than daylight. Grandmother had never been so grand and beautiful. She took the little girl in her arms, and both of them flew in brightness and joy above the earth, very, very high, and up there was neither cold, nor hunger, nor fear-they were with God.</p>

            <p>But in the corner, leaning against the wall, sat the little girl with red cheeks and smiling mouth, frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. The New Year's sun rose upon a little pathetic figure. The child sat there, stiff and cold, holding the matches, of which one bundle was almost burned.</p>

            <p>&quot;She wanted to warm herself,&quot; the people said. No one imagined what beautiful things she had seen, and how happily she had gone with her old grandmother into the bright New Year.</p>

            <p>One day Niginella met a knight called Thomas Potter in kingdom market called FacebookBazar. Thomas was very pleased and encouraged to
                see Niginella and asked for her profile in FacebookBazar. After that, they talked every day until nightfall and planned to eat pizza.
                They met each other and ate delicious pizza. After a delicious pizza, they agreed to go to the festival called MegaKingdom Festival.

                At the festival, Niginella invited her friends and successfully entered the festival through the security guards. There was a lot of delicious food at the festival, a lot of great songs. Niginella and Thomas danced to the cool music until the night.
                After the festival, Niginella and Thomas agreed to eat delicious and juicy wings and watch a movie called Knight 007.

                Very bad things happened after a cool festival. The bad dragon kidnapped Niginella and took her to his castle. Then Thomas  shouted at the dragon:

                <p className="princeWarning">

                    <br />
                    -  But my hand's been broken, one too many times
                    <br/>
                    - So I'll use my sword to kill you at all
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Thomas finally found the bad dragon and defeated him. Niginella was suuccessfully saved and now she can be with her family in New Year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thomas looked into her beautiful eyes and he was happy he could save her from the dragon.
